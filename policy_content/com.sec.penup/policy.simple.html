Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., along with our affiliates and subsidiaries, (collectively, &#x201C;Samsung&#x201D;) knows how important privacy is to our customers. This Privacy Policy describes the personal information we may obtain online across all of our Internet-connected Samsung devices and services (from mobile phones and tablets to TVs, home appliances, online services, and more) (collectively, our &#x201C;Services&#x201D;), and how we may use and disclose that information.

<ul> <i>Information you provide to us</i><br>

<ul> <i>Information we collect automatically</i><br>
</ul>
Our Services collect some data automatically when you use the Services. We may obtain information by automated means such as through browser cookies, pixels, web server logs, web beacons, and other technologies. Among other purposes, these technologies help us (1) remember your information so you will not have to re-enter it, (2) track and understand how you use and interact with the Services, (3) tailor the Services around your preferences, (4) manage and measure the usability of the Services, (5) understand the effectiveness of our communications, and (6) otherwise enhance the Services. Information we may collect automatically includes information about<ul> <li>&#x2022; your device, including MAC address, IP address, log information, device model, hardware model, IMEI number, serial number, subscription information, device settings, connections to other devices, mobile network operator, web browser characteristics, app usage information, sales code, access code, current software version, MNC, subscription information and randomized, non-persistent and resettable device identifiers, such as Personalized Service ID (or PSID), and advertising IDs, including Google Ad ID;</li> <li>&#x2022; your use of the Services, including clickstream data, your interactions with the Services (such as the web pages you visit, search terms, and the apps and features you use), the pages that led or referred you to the Services, dates and times of use of the Services; and</li> <li>&#x2022; your use of third-party websites, apps and features that are connected to certain Services. </li>

Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. You can find out how to do this for your particular browser by clicking &#x201C;help&#x201D; on your browser&#x2019;s menu or visiting <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. For mobile devices, you can manage how your device and browser share certain device data by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your device. The Services are not designed to respond to &#x201C;do not track&#x201D; signals received from browsers. Please note that without cookies you may not be able to use or benefit from all of the features of our Services.<br>

Through certain Services, we may collect personal information about your online activities on websites and connected devices over time and across third-party websites, devices, apps and other online features and services. We may use third-party analytics services on the Services, such as Google Analytics. The information we obtain may be disclosed to or collected directly by these providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Services or help administer the Services.

<i>Ad networks</i></p>
Because Samsung participates in various advertising networks, you may also see our ads on other websites or mobile apps. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users&#x2019; inferred interests and browsing context. These networks can track users&#x2019; online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of browser cookies, web beacons, pixels, device identifiers, server logs and other similar technologies. The networks use this information to show ads that may be tailored to individuals&#x2019; interests, to track users&#x2019; browsers or devices across multiple websites and apps, and to build a profile of users&#x2019; online browsing and app usage activities. The information our ad networks may collect includes data about users&#x2019; visits to websites and apps that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or ads viewed and the actions taken on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on certain Services and on third-party websites and apps that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. <p>

<p>
<strong>Access:</strong> You may have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected, used, disclosed and sold about you during the past 12 months. </p>
<p>
<strong>Deletion:</strong> You have the right to request that we delete certain personal information we have collected from you. </p>
<p>
<strong>Opt-Out of Sale:</strong> You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information. </p>
<p>
<strong>Shine the Light Request:</strong> You also may have the right to request that we provide you with (1) a list of certain categories of personal information we have disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year and (2) the identity of those third parties. </p>
<p>
<strong>How to Submit a Request:</strong> To submit an access or deletion request, <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/privacy/ccpa">click here</a> or call us at 1-800-SAMSUNG (1-800-726-7864). To submit a Shine the Light request, email us at <a href="mailto:NAPrivacy@sea.samsung.com">NAPrivacy@sea.samsung.com</a>. To opt-out of the sale of your personal information, <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/privacy/ccpa">click here</a> or call us at 1-800-SAMSUNG (1-800-726-7864). </p>
<p>
<strong>Verifying Requests:</strong> To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request. If you have a Samsung.com account, we will verify your identity by requiring you to sign in to your account. If you do not have a Samsung.com account, or an email address on file with us, then there is no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity to the level of certainty required by the CCPA. This is because historically Samsung has not linked device identifiers or advertising IDs to named actual persons. Accordingly, if you do not have an account with us, or an email address on file, and you request access to or deletion of your personal information, we will not be able to process your request at this time. </p>
<p>
<strong>Additional Information:</strong> If you choose to exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, you have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment by us. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request. This Statement is available in alternative formats upon request.

<strong>SAMSUNG PRIVACY POLICY &#x2013; SMART TV SUPPLEMENT</strong></p> Samsung&#x2019;s Smart TV service offers a set of features that provide enhanced video content, customized TV experiences, movies, connections to social networking services, and the ability to control and interact with your Smart TV with voice commands. We collect, use, share, and store information through your Smart TV and the devices connected with your Smart TV in the ways described in the Samsung Privacy Policy. This Supplement provides additional details about the privacy practices of some Smart TV features. The Smart TV is designed to enable you to easily find and access video programming and other content. For example, you may access information about live television programs distributed to you by your cable or satellite operator and on-demand video content offerings distributed by third party content providers through searchable guides displayed on your Smart TV. In the case of live television programs, we determine what content is available to you based in part on your postcode. In addition, the Smart TV helps you find and experience other Smart TV content more relevant to you by highlighting programming and content that is likely to interest you or providing additional services that will enhance your viewing experience. We base these recommendations and additional services on: &#x2022; Information about content that you have watched, purchased, downloaded, or streamed through Samsung applications on your Smart TV or other devices (About the TV viewing information please see &#x2018;Viewing Information Services&#x2019; section below);
&#x2022; Information about applications you have accessed through the Smart TV;
&#x2022; Information about your clicks on the &#x201C;Like&#x201D;, &#x201C;Dislike&#x201D;, &#x201C;Watch Now&#x201D;, and other buttons on your Smart TV;
&#x2022; The query terms you enter into Smart TV search features, including when you search for particular video content;
&#x2022; Other Smart TV usage and device information, including, but not limited to, IP address, log data, information that identifies your hardware or software configuration, browser information, and the page(s) you request.
<p>
<i>Viewing Information Services</i></p>
<p>
This privacy notice should be read in conjunction with the Samsung Privacy Policy, which also applies to your receipt of customized Smart TV experiences and can be found at <a href="https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms/privacypolicy">https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms/privacypolicy</a>.</p> In order to provide you with customized Smart TV experiences, some of our feature and services will rely on your TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information. Your TV viewing history includes information about the networks, channels, websites visited and programs viewed on your Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them. We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture this information. Your Smart TV transfers video snippets or TV tuner information in order to determine the programs watched. You may change your privacy choice at any time by going to the settings menu to disable the particular feature or service at your sole discretion, in which case your TV viewing history will cease to be collected for that particular feature or service. Bear in mind that your privacy choice may affect the availability or quality of the specific viewing information based service.
<p>
<i>Interest-Based Advertisement Services</i></p> The Interest-Based Advertisement Services (the &#x201C;IBA Services&#x201D;) is designed to provide the ability to obtain and view useful, interactive, and interest based advertisements about products and services offered by Samsung and third parties on your Samsung Smart TV or across various Samsung and third party platforms or devices, including linear commercials, on the web, mobile devices, and tablets. In order to make the advertising on your devices more relevant to you, the IBA service will rely on your TV viewing history (including information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programs viewed on your Samsung Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them), Samsung Smart TV usage information, and other statistical data obtained from trusted third party data sources. We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture your TV viewing history. Based on the information above we create groups of Samsung Smart TV owners who share similar interests and use these groups for the IBA Service. The information above is used to determine the groups to which your Samsung Smart TV is assigned and thus, which advertisements your devices receive. You may disable the IBA Service at any time by visiting the Settings menu on your Samsung Smart TV. Please note that your privacy choice with respect to the IBA Service will not affect whether or not you receive or are served with other types of ads and marketing that are not specifically based on TV viewing history or Samsung Smart TV usage information. Those other types of ads and marketing will be based on other information such as generalized location and other estimated or inferred information. They might be less relevant because they are not based on your interests. For more detailed information about the IBA Services, please refer to the IBA Services Privacy Notice at the bottom of this Supplement.
<p>
<i>PSID</i></p> Your Smart TV viewing history and usage information collected for the purposes of providing interest based advertisements will be linked to a randomized, non-persistent, and resettable device identifier called the Personalized Service ID or &#x201C;PSID&#x201D;. You may reset your PSID at any time by visiting the Settings menu on your Smart TV and, once reset, your Smart TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information with respect to interest based advertisements will be de-linked from its previous PSID. Bear in mind that if you reset your PSID, the quality of customized and interest based advertisements may not be fine-tuned.
<p>
<i>Voice Recognition</i></p> You can control your Smart TV, and use many of its features, with voice commands. If you enable Voice Recognition, you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice. To provide the Voice Recognition feature, your voice commands will be transmitted (along with information about your device, including device identifiers) to us and we will convert your voice commands into text to provide the Voice Recognition features. In addition, Samsung may collect voice commands and associated texts so that we can evaluate and improve the features. Samsung will collect your voice commands when you make a specific request to the Smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on your screen or by speaking a wake word (e.g. &#x201C;Hi, Bixby&#x201D;) and speaking into the microphone on the remote control or Smart TV. If you do not enable Voice Recognition, you will not be able to use the voice recognition features.
You may disable Voice Recognition data collection at any time by visiting the Settings menu. However, this would prevent you from using the Voice Recognition features. For more detailed information about the Voice Recognition, please refer to the Voice Recognition Privacy Notice at the bottom of this Supplement.
<p>
<i>Third Parties</i></p> Please note that when you watch a video or access applications or content provided by a third party, that provider may collect or receive information about your Smart TV (e.g. its IP address and device identifiers), the requested transaction (e.g. your request to buy or rent the video), and your use of the application or service.
