        <p>
          CalOPPA is the first state law in the United States that requires
          commercial websites and online services to publish a privacy policy. The
          law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any individual or
          company in the US (and conceivably the world) that operates sites
          collecting PII from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy
          policy on its website stating precisely the information that it collects
          and those individuals or companies with whom it is shared.

          According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Users can visit the site anonymously.

            Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our

          The Fair Information Practices Principles is the backbone of the privacy
          law in the United States. It also plays a significant role in developing
          data protection laws across the globe. It is, therefore, essential to
          understand the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be
          implemented in compliance with the various privacy laws to protect personal
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          In agreement with the Fair Information Practices, following responsive
          actions will be taken, should a data breach instance occur:         
        </p>

            Within 7 business days
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We will notify the users via in-site notification
        </p>

        </ul>
        <p>       
          We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle according to which
          individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against
          those who collect and process data and fail to adhere to the law. As per
          this principle individuals not only have enforceable rights against data
          users but also that they have recourse to courts or legal agencies to
          investigate and/or prosecute by data processors.
